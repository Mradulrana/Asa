                    <p>Dermatology medical billing is the best of what we do in the USA. Most providers do not realize
                        that dermatology medical billing services initiate a patient’s first contact with the medical
                        practitioner’s office. The process starts with the initial scheduling process and goes through
                        the entire procedure till the point where the entirety of the remaining bill is paid. Here
                        expert billers confirm what parts of treatment are covered and then calculate how much the payor
                        will pay. In this way, patients fully understand the bills from the beginning, thus eliminating
                        the probability of any surprises which may result in unpaid bills.</p>

                        in dermatology fall under multiple procedure rules; thus, an in-depth understanding of post-op
                        periods and modifiers is necessary.

                                Upcoding refers to the act of billing for a more expensive treatment or procedure than what was performed, while on the other hand, down coding is filing a claim for a less expensive procedure. Both of these are illegal and could lead to charges of fraud.
